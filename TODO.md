# TODO

## Needs fixing
- Fix view of dialog on mobile
- Add animations to dialog
- Fix annoying Lighthouse complaint about `Page prevented back/forward cache
  restoration` which brings down site performance.
- Thoroughly test on all browsers (though it does work on Chrome, Safari and
  Firefox on macOS);

## Nice to haves
- Use a button for dark mode instead of relying on user preference.
- Use an intersection observer to only show bookable rooms when in view.
- Hook up a real backend so state persists between refreshes.
